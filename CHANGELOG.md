## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-14 — Phase 1: Checkout/Order/Payment/Inventory Integrity

### Fixed — Security & Data Integrity

- Checkout now creates orders entirely server-side via a new atomic `create_order` Postgres RPC, which re-derives every price from the live `products` table — closes the gap where a client could previously submit arbitrary prices/totals directly to the database
- Order status transitions are now guarded by an explicit state machine (`OrderService`); invalid transitions are rejected with a 409 instead of silently corrupting order state
- Payment verification/rejection now correctly manages stock reservations end-to-end: `reserved_quantity` increments on order creation and is either consumed (stock decremented) or released depending on the payment outcome — previously reservations were never tracked at all
- Payment screenshots are now served via signed URLs from a genuinely private Supabase Storage bucket — previously the code called `getPublicUrl()` on a private bucket, which never worked
- A scheduled `pg_cron` job auto-cancels stale unconfirmed orders and releases their reservations hourly
- Fixed two write-ordering bugs (found and fixed during review) where a dependent status/payment field was persisted before an operation that could still fail, risking permanently inconsistent state: `OrderService.updateStatus` and `PaymentService.verifyPayment`/`rejectPayment` now perform the risky operation first and only persist the "succeeded" status after
- Fixed a state-regression hole in the guest screenshot-upload route where resubmitting a screenshot could silently force an already-progressed order backward — the route now goes through the guarded state machine instead of a raw DB write
- Fixed a pre-existing `profiles` table RLS infinite-recursion bug (discovered during this phase's live verification) that was silently breaking the product detail page and any other query embedding an admin-gated table

### Added

- `InventoryService`, `OrderService`, `PaymentService`, `CheckoutService` — new service layer for checkout/order/payment logic, following the repository → service → route pattern from Phase 0
- `POST /api/checkout`, `POST /api/checkout/:orderId/screenshot`, `PATCH /api/admin/orders/:id/status`, payment verify/reject routes
- `/admin/payments` page for admins to verify/reject payments and view screenshots

### Removed

- Dead `/api/orders` route (superseded by `/api/checkout`), duplicate `auth/redirect` route, empty `/api/setup` directory

### Verified

- Full test suite: 29 suites / 133 tests passing
- `npm run type-check`: no errors
- Live end-to-end verification against production Supabase: real order created with server-computed pricing, reservation incremented on order, stock decremented and reservation released on admin verify

See `TASKS.md` for the full list.
